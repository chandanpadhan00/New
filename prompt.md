Excellent question — and this is a very smart approach. If you want GPT-5 (like me) to fully explain an Informatica PowerCenter workflow (from XML), especially for training, onboarding, or knowledge transfer, you need a carefully engineered, layered prompt.

Below is a ready-to-use master prompt template 👇 that you can copy-paste whenever you upload your workflow XML file.

🔹 Prompt Template for GPT-5: Informatica Workflow Deep Explanation

> Prompt:

You are an expert Informatica PowerCenter architect and trainer.
I’m sharing a complete Informatica workflow XML file — please analyze it in depth and explain everything in a way that even a beginner (someone starting a career in Informatica) can understand and grow to an expert level.

Your explanation must cover the following sections in order:


---

🧩 1. Workflow Overview

Workflow name, folder, purpose, and dependencies.

What this workflow does in business terms (e.g., delta load, dimension update, data merge, etc.).

Type of workflow (manual, scheduled, parameterized, reusable, etc.).


⚙️ 2. Session-Level Breakdown

For each session (s_m_...):

Mapping name and purpose.

Source(s) and target(s) used (name, type: table/flat file/view).

Transformation list (with short explanation for each).

Workflow logic flow (source → transformations → target).

Any lookup, joiner, expression, router, aggregator, filter, update strategy, or sequence generator.

Load type (full/delta/merge/upsert).

Any variables, parameters, or mapping parameter files used.


🧱 3. Command & Control Tasks

Purpose of each CMD_to_... or command task (e.g., triggers a shell script, merges data, or executes pre/post SQL).

What these commands do (SQL, shell, PMCMD, etc.).

Any dependency between command and session tasks.


🕸️ 4. Workflow Sequence & Dependencies

The execution flow (order of tasks, triggers, pre/post dependency logic).

What happens first, middle, and last.

Decision or event wait tasks, if any.


🧠 5. Parameterization & Reusability

Which parts use workflow variables, mapping variables, or parameter files.

How this workflow adapts between environments (DEV/UAT/PROD).

Use of reusable sessions, mappings, or transformations.


🧾 6. Error Handling & Recovery

How session failure is handled (fail parent, continue, retry logic).

Any audit, logging, or reject flows.

Error tables or workflow notification emails.


📊 7. Performance & Optimization

Explain any partitioning, caching, or pushdown optimization.

Suggestions for performance improvement if the workflow is large or slow.


🧭 8. Business Understanding Summary

Summarize what real-world business process this workflow supports (e.g., "Daily delta sync of Veeva CRM accounts from DIH").

What happens if it fails.

How this data impacts downstream systems.



---

Finally:
End with a diagram-like text summary of the entire workflow, showing the flow order (e.g., Start → Pre-Load Snapshot → Staging → Merge → Post-Load Validation → Audit → End).

Use clear Markdown formatting with tables, bullet points, and headings so the explanation reads like a mini training guide or SOP document.

✅ Example (Short Version of What GPT Will Produce)

### Workflow: DAILY_DIH_TO_VEEVA_ACCOUNTS_DELTA_v_2_00
**Purpose:** Daily incremental load of Account data from DIH to Veeva CRM.

**Flow Summary:**
1. s_m_DIH_COMPASS_RUN_STARTTIME → initializes parameters.
2. s_m_MIR_VEEVA_ACCOUNTS_VEEVA_Before_Load → pulls source delta.
3. s_m_WRK_TRN_VEEVA_ACCOUNT → loads working table.
4. CMD_to_trigger_Account_Merge → executes merge script.
5. s_m_MIR_VEEVA_ACCOUNTS_VEEVA_After_Load → post-validation.
6. CMD_to_Trigger_Account_HierarchyAddress → builds hierarchy.
7. End → flags completion in audit tables.

🧠 Pro Tip (for Better Results)

After GPT-5’s first explanation, you can follow up with:

“Now create a training summary for new Informatica developers based on this workflow.”

“Create a flowchart-style text diagram showing session order.”

“Explain this workflow’s transformations in detail with examples of row flow.”

“Explain only the s_m_WRK_TRN_VEEVA_ACCOUNT_1_00 session in detail.”

Would you like me to prepare a ready-to-copy one-liner version (shorter but equally powerful) for when you paste your XML file directly?
